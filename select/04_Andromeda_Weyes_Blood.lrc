[00:18.58] Andromeda's a big, wide open galaxy
[00:24.64] Nothing in it for me except a heart that's lazy
[00:32.13] Running from my own life now
[00:35.82] I'm really turning some time
[00:39.48] Looking up to the sky for something I may never find
[01:05.48] 
[00:50.07] Stop calling
[00:56.84] It's time to let me be
[01:05.26] If you think you can save me
[01:08.65] I'd dare you to try
[01:18.15] 
[01:31.44] Left the heart from the depths it's fallen through
[01:38.10] We all want something new
[01:40.86] But it can't seem to follow through
[01:45.31] Something's better than nothing
[01:48.97] Or so that I thought
[01:52.73] Now I know it's just one dream
[01:56.38] All these others gonna tear me apart
[02:14.38] 
[02:03.21] Love is calling
[02:09.94] It's time to let it through
[02:18.22] Find a love that will make you
[02:21.62] I dare you try
[02:28.62] 
[02:44.26] Crazy guy
[02:47.16] Think this is deep
[02:50.75] Think it's meant to be
[02:54.71] More than anything I can think of
[02:58.27] I'm ready to try
[03:06.27] 
[03:06.22] Treat me right
[03:08.59] I'm still a good man's daughter
[03:13.43] Let me in if I break
[03:15.92] And be quiet if I shatter
[03:20.57] Getting tired of looking
[03:23.49] You know that I hate the game
[03:27.80] Don't wanna waste any more time
[03:31.41] You know I didn't hold it up
[03:45.41] 
[03:38.52] Love is calling
[03:45.12] It's time to give to you
[03:53.40] Something you can hold onto
[03:56.89] I dare you try
