Woe to the one
Who boast in front of the Gods
Woe to the God
Who is petty and jealous to mortals
Woe to the beast
Who blindly obeys
Woe to the king
Who, like a fool, sacrifices his own kin
Gods and heroes shall fade away in time
She will live forever
Our queen Andromeda
Why is it hollow fame that men seek?
And love the beast inside of you and me
""You shall not harm the maiden of my dreams
Come and face your demise, monster of the deep!""
Gods and heroes shall fade away in time
She will live forever
Our queen Andromeda
Gods and heroes shall fade away in time
She will live forever
Our queen Andromeda
Pages of time crumble before our eyes
Unlike the awe for immortal skies
""You shall not have the maiden of my dreams
Kneel, flee or I'll cast a curse of stone upon thee!""
Gods and heroes shall fade away in time
She will live forever
Our queen Andromeda
Gods and heroes shall fade away in time
She will live forever
Our queen Andromeda
